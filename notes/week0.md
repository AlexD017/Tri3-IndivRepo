## TPT 0.1 Beneficial and Harmful Effects of Computing Big Idea 5.1
### Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing

#### Beneficial:
* Effcient work from multitasking
* Less errors are made from computers than hand 
* Faster communication and collaboration 

#### Harmful:
* Unhealthy mental and physical issues
* Cyber crimes such as privacy problems (ransomware)
* Reduces time spent in real life

### Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
Dopamine issues are real, neither parent conspiracy nor fake. Anyone can get dopamine from doing something enjoyable, such as gaming, eating, shopping, etc, but having too much can be a problem. People get addicted and start becoming aggressive. They can't control themselves. A lot of the times, many students, like me, spend time playing games, go on SNS, or go outside when they are supposed to study and work on self-development for school. Sometimes, when I'm on my phone looking at social media, I think that I need to focus on what I should do first than getting distracted to what I shouldn't.

## TPT 0.2 Digital Divide Big Idea 5.2
### How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
Many people empower themselves into the digital world by accessing to the technology they have nearby. As time have passed, technology has improved and made it much easier for people to have access on the Internet. 
### How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
Someone that is empowered can offer and show their internet access to the others who are not empowered. For example, in our school, Del Norte High School, we can create a club that show and describe what digital world looks like and how it works.
### Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
Personally, I do not think that a paper or red tape is blocking digital empowerment. Most people nowadays have their own laptops, computers, or phones to empower themselves into the digital world. In Del Norte, the district is providing Chromebooks to the students, which are actually cutting down that barrier or red tape for digital empowerment.
