# Week 1: (3/14/22 ~ 3/18/22)

## TPT 5.3 Computing Bias 
### Notes:
* Computers sometimes can have bias in their funcion or algorithm
* Mostly unintentional bias, but can cause serious problems for developers
* Sometimes intentional/purposeful, such as advertising and voice recognition
* Programmers/developers should take actions to reduce the bias used for computing innovations 

### Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional? Justify your conclusion.
The owner of the computer does not think that this was intentional because he repeats that his blackness is causing the computer to not detect his face and takes it as a joke.  
### How do you think this happened?
The computer camera is only programmed and trained to detect lighter skin color
### Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?
This is harmful computing bias because even though the software is not created for an intended purpose, it only failed to detect people with dark skin.
### Should it be corrected?
It should be corrected if the company that made this software don't want to be labeled as racist. 
### What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome? 
To produce a better outcome, you can collect the face datas from all around the world and let the software train with them.

## TPT 5.4 Crowdsourcing 
### Notes: 
* Crowdsourcing provides the ability to obtain shared information, share information, and participate in distributed computing
* More crowdsourcing, the more you reduce Computer Bias
> * Wikipedia has a ton of information from crowdsourcing; can have inaccurate informations, but corrected through a self-policing community
> * Crypto currency; all exchanges of money are valicated at least 3 times by independent miners
> * RapidAPI; many programmers perform their tasks with tons of APIs created from other people
> * GitHub; can create own repository, or fork and clone repositories from others; can also obtain profiles and history about the persons coding history

### CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?
One crowdsourcing idea for CSP students is a class website for the students to collaborate and create lines of codes to give live feedbacks.
### What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?
Del Norte crowdsourcing can be a survey for DNHS students to input their responses about their mental health or academic workload. This could improve our final project by providing data and can be implmented for many reasons in our website.
