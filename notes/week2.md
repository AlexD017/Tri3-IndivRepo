## TPT 5.5 Legal and Ethic Concerns 
### Notes:
* **IP (Intellectual Property)**: a work on invention that is the result of creaticity to which one has rights
  * Eveything that we create can be IP; inventions, literary works, designs, images, etc.
* **Copyright**: protects your IP and keeps anyone from using it, unless you give them your permission
  > * **Plagiarism**: presenting material as your own
* **Creative Commons**: provides free liicenses that you can use to tell others how you want them to use your creations
  * Clearly tells others what they can and can't do with your IP
* **Open Source**: programs made freely availabe for anyone to use and may be redistributed and modified
  * Encourages open collaboration; make modifications and redistribute
* **Open Access**: online research output free of any and all restrictions on access and free of many restrictions on use, such as copyright or license restrictions
* **Digital Divide**: unequal distribution of access to technology

### When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in GitHub pages.
GitHub offers many licenses when you create a GitHub repository. Some examples include: Academic Free License, Apache License, Creative Commons License Family, MIT License, etc. All of these licenses have to do with computing and all fall under the topic of Legal and Ethical Concerns.

### Make a license for your personal and Team project. Document license you picked and why.
For both personal and Team project, I chose MIT license because it is the most reliable license and allows for most people to use it freely

## TPT 5.6 Safe Computing
### Notes:
* **PII (Personal Identifiable Information)**: any information that can be used to trace anyone's identity
  > * Can be used to cnhance a user's online experience
  > * Can be exploited if privacy and other protections are igonored
  > * Ex: age, race, date of birth, email address, phone number, etc. 
* Google, Facebook, and Twitter gather more information about behavior with their share, retweet, and like buttons they have embedded on the site
* **Authentication**: measures protect devices and information from unauthorized access
  > **Strong Passwords should contain**: 
     > * 10 ore more characters
     > * Must contain a symbol
     > * Must contain a bumber
     > * Must contain lowercase and uppercse letters
     
  > **Multi-factor Authentication**:
    > * what you know
    > * what you have
    > * what you are
 
**Virus & Malware**
 * **Virus**: malicious programs that can copy themselves and gain access to systems that they are not supposed to be allowed in
 * **Malware**: often intended to damage a computing system or take partial control over its operation
   * Can infiltrate a system by posing as legitimate programs or by attaching itself to legitimate programs, like and email attachment

**Encryption & Decryption**
  * **Encryption**: the process of encoding data to prevent unauthorized access
    * Symmetric Encryption: one key used to both encrypt and decrypt data
    * Asymmetric Encryption: uses two keys 
  * **Decryption**: the process of decoding data 

**Phishing**
  * **Phising**: an attempt to trick a user into providing personal information, such as usernames, passwords, account numbers, etc.
    * Can trick you into clicking a link or opening an attachment in emails
    * Can lead to...
      > * virus installed on computer
      > * spoofed banking website
      > * keylogger installed
    * Keylogger: recprds every keystroke made by a user in order to gain fraudulent access to passwords or other confidental informations
    * Rogue Access Point: a wireless network that can give unauthorizes access to secure networks
    
### Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles.
In Trimester 2, my team worked on the CRUD Project. In the project, we used CRUD and databases to store Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as names, ages, usernames, emails, phone numbers, passwords, etc.

### What are your feelings about PII and your exposure?
PII should not be displayed if it contains sensitive information. For example, I would not want to have my password displayed for anyone to see.

### Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication.
Good passwords should contain 10 or more characters, a symbol, a number, and both lowercase and uppercase letters. Bad passwords lack these aspects and are usually not complex.
**Good Password**: @l3x9@$$w0r6
**Bad Password**: alexpassword
You can also authenticate your identity with your username, your driver license, and your face

### Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption.
**Symmetric encryption**: method of encrypting a message so that only the sender and receiver can read it

**Asymmetric encryption**: also known as public-key encryption, uses one public key and one private key to encrypt and decrypt a message and protect it from unauthorized access

### Provide and example of encryption we used in deployment.
SSL Enscryption would be an exmaple we used in deployment

### Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques.
There were some phone calls that were phishing calls, but I never fell because I already knew it was a phishing call. Some phishing techniques include the fake invoice scam, the email account upgrade scam, the paypal scam, and other things
