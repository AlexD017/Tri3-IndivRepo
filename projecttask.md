## Coding Reflection for Week
Throughout the week, I didn't have much time to work on our team's project task. However, in the beginning of this Data Structures class, we have assigned at least 1 issue to each other, that was about our project purpose from our sponsor. Our project sponsor wanted a website that was focued on productivity and wellness of his students. The first day, I was planning which mathtool could be useful to the students who are working hard in their colleges. Then, I've chosen a calculator, which could be useful to some students. Even though I created a very simple calculator with a few operations, such as addition, substraction, division, and multiplication. I hoped it could help some students who are majored in any math classes. However, this project task will be improved as a better calculator by the day when we deploy our website.
